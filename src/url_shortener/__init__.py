"""
URL Shortener package.

This package follows a layered architecture inspired by Domainâ€‘Driven Design (DDD).
It separates concerns into domain, repositories, services, utilities, and
application layers.  The goal of this design is to isolate each layer's
responsibilities so that the core business logic (the domain) can evolve
independently from infrastructure details such as persistence or web
frameworks.  See the accompanying README for an overview of the project
structure and design rationale.
